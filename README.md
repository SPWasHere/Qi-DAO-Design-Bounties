# Qi-DAO-Design-Bounties
Hey everyone, Qi DAO community, and the OG Qimps!
I made these designs in a way following the ancient art style and getting inspiration from Taoism. 
Compared though to the style of their art back then with the limitations brought about by using actual ink, 
I was able to put much brighter colors and gradients to make the characters pop while still following the style and the brand.
Hope you guys like it!
